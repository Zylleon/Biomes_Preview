  <description>
This is a standalone playable preview of the atoll biome from the upcoming Biomes! Islands mod.
This preview is for 1.0 only, but the full release will be for 1.1 only. The preview will not be updated for 1.1

Included are the basic atoll biome, new plants and animals, and a unique terrain for the lagoon.

This preview does not contain the full features planned for Islands, but instead contains a pre-release version of the atoll biome in a playable state.

This version will not see significant support, and very few updates. Main development is going towards the full release of Islands.

Compatible with:
FishIndustry
Vanilla Fishing Expandd
Camo and Stealth
